Introduction
============

A social account is a user account where authentication is delegated to an
external identity provider. The ``allauth.socialaccount`` app is responsible for
managing social accounts. It supports:

- Connecting one or more social accounts to a local/regular account

- Disconnecting a social account -- requires setting a password if
  only the local account remains

- Optional instant-signup for social accounts -- no questions asked

Note that in order to use this functionality you need to install the ``socialaccount``
extras of the ``django-allauth`` package::

  pip install django-allauth[socialaccount]
