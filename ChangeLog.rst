0.45.0 (2021-07-11)
*******************


Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New providers: Feishu, NetIQ, Frontier, CILogin.


0.44.0 (2020-11-25)
*******************

Security notice
---------------

In previous versions, the mechanism to prevent too many failed login attempts
(``ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_LIMIT``) could be bypassed by changing the casing of
the login.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- The ``certificate`` key part of the ``SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS`` configuration has
  been renamed to ``certificate_key``. This is done to prevent the key from being displayed
  without being masked in Django debug pages.

0.44.0
******

- Better compatibility with Django 3.2


0.43.0 (2020-10-15)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New translation: Slovenian.

- If ``ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_LIMIT`` is set and the user successfully
  resets their password, the timeout is cleared to allow immediate login.

- You can now limit the amount of email addresses a user can associate to his
  account by setting ``ACCOUNT_MAX_EMAIL_ADDRESSES``.

- New providers: Apple, Okta, Stocktwits, Zoho, Zoom.

- If email verification is set to mandatory, the email address you use to login
  with must now be verified as well. In previous versions, it was sufficient if
  the account had at least one verified email address, not necessarily the one
  used to login with.

- Added a new setting: ``ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_REDIRECT_URL`` -- the URL (or URL
  name) to redirect to directly after signing up.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- In previous versions, the ``allauth`` app included a ``base.html``
  template. This template could conflict with an equally named template at
  project level. Therefore, ``base.html`` has now been moved to
  ``account/base.html`` -- you will need to check your templates and likely
  override ``account/base.html`` within your project.


0.42.0 (2020-05-24)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New providers: EDX, Yandex, Mixer.

- Fixed Twitch ``get_avatar_url()`` method to use the profile picture retrieved
  by new user details endpoint introduced in version 0.40.0.

- The Facebook API version now defaults to v7.0.


0.41.0 (2019-12-18)
*******************

Security notice
---------------

- See `CVE-2019-19844
  <https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2019/dec/18/security-releases/>`_.


Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New providers: Exist.io., YNAB, Amazon Cognito.

- You can now store OAuth credentials directly in your
  ``settings.SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS`` settings instead of storing them in the
  database using a ``SocialApp`` record.

- Adding Keycloak Provider


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Dropped Python 2 and Django 1 compatibility.


0.40.0 (2019-08-29)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- The ``instagram`` provider now extracts the user's full name.

- New provider: NextCloud (OAuth2)

- Added an ``SDK_URL`` setting for customizing the loading of the Facebook
  JavaScript SDK.

- Updated Twitch provider to use new authentication endpoints
  (``https://id.twitch.tv``) over deprecated v5 endpoints
  (``https://api.twitch.tv/kraken``)

- Added support for Patreon API v2, with API v1 set as default for
  backwards compatibility.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- ``Twitch``: The new API's profile data is different in both
  structure and content than the old V5 endpoint. Any project
  that relies on data from ``SocialAccount.extra_data`` should
  refer to the new API user endpoint documentation:
  https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-users


0.39.1 (2019-02-28)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- The ``linkedin_oauth2`` provider now gracefully deals with old V1
  data that might still be present in ``SocialAccount.extra_data``.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- The ``globus`` provider's ``extract_uid`` now uses the openid
  required field ``sub`` instead of the ``create_time`` field.


0.39.0 (2019-02-26)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New providers: JupyterHub (OAuth2), Steam (OpenID)

- Refactor translations: Portuguese (Portugal).

- Add testing for Django 2.2 (no code changes required)

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- ``linkedin_oauth2``: As the LinkedIn V1 API is deprecated, the user info
  endpoint has been moved over to use the API V2. The format of the user
  ``extra_data`` is different and the profile picture is absent by default.


0.38.0 (2018-10-03)
*******************

Security notice
---------------

The ``{% user_display user %}`` tag did not escape properly. Depending on the
username validation rules, this could lead to XSS issues.


Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New provider: Vimeo (OAuth2).

- New translations: Basque.


0.37.1 (2018-08-27)
*******************

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Dropped the ``x-li-src: msdk`` headers from the ``linkedin_oauth2`` handshake.
  This header is only required for mobile tokens, and breaks the regular flow.
  Use the ``HEADERS`` setting to add this header if you need it.


0.37.0 (2018-08-27)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- The Battle.net login backend now recognizes ``apac`` as a valid region.

- User model using a ``UUIDField`` as it's primary key can now be logged
  in upon email confirmation (if using ``ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ON_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION``).

- New providers: Agave, Cern, Disqus, Globus.

- New translation: Danish.

0.36.0 (2018-05-08)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New providers: Telegram, QuickBooks.

- The Facebook API version now defaults to v2.12.

- ORCID upgraded to use API v2.1.


Security notice
---------------

- In previous versions, the authentication backend did not invoke the
  ``user_can_authenticate()`` method, potentially allowing users with
  ``is_active=False`` to authenticate when the allauth authentication backend
  was used in a non allauth context.


0.35.0 (2018-02-02)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Add support for Django 2.0

Security notice
---------------

- As an extra security measure on top of what the standard Django password reset
  token generator is already facilitating, allauth now adds the user email
  address to the hash such that whenever the user's email address changes the
  token is invalidated.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Drop support for Django 1.8 and Django 1.10.


Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New provider: Azure, Microsoft Graph, Salesforce, Yahoo.


0.34.0 (2017-10-29)
*******************

Security notice
---------------

- The "Set Password" view did not properly check whether or not the user already
  had a usable password set. This allowed an attacker to set the password
  without providing the current password, but only in case the attacker already
  gained control over the victim's session.


Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New provider: Meetup.


0.33.0 (2017-08-20)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Security: password reset tokens are now prevented from being leaked through
  the password reset URL.

- New providers: Patreon, Authentiq, Dataporten.

- Dropbox has been upgraded to API V2.

- New translation: Norwegian.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Dropped support for Django 1.9.


0.32.0 (2017-04-27)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Improved AJAX support: the account management views (change/set password,
  manage e-mail addresses and social connections) now support AJAX GET requests.
  These views hand over all the required data for you to build your frontend
  application upon.

- New providers: Dwolla, Trello.

- Shopify: support for per-user access mode.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- In previous versions, the views only responded with JSON responses when
  issuing AJAX requests of type POST. Now, the views also respond in JSON when
  making AJAX GET requests.

- The structure of the response for AJAX requests has changed. Previously, it
  contained a ``form_errors`` key containing all form validation errors, if any.
  Now, it contains a ``form`` key that describes the complete form, including
  the fields. Field specific errors are placed in
  ``form.fields['some_field'].errors``, non-field errors in ``form.errors``.

- The parameters passed to the Facebook JS SDK ``FB.init()`` method used to contain
  ``cookie``, ``status``, and ``xfbml``, all set to ``true``. These parameters
  are no longer explicitly passed. You can use the newly introduced ``INIT_PARAMS``
  provider setting to provide your own values.



0.31.0 (2017-02-28)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Added a new ``user_logged_out`` signal.

- OpenId: Added support for requesting additional data.

- New providers: Auth0, Box, Line, Naver, Kakao, Daum, MailChimp, Eventbrite.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Django 1.7 / Python 3.2 compatibility has been dropped.

- Due to providers being registered in the same file as their definition
  it was impossible to subclass a provider without having the parent be
  registered. This has been addressed. If you have implemented a custom
  provider, you will need to change
  ``providers.registry.register(CustomProvider)``
  into
  ``provider_classes = [CustomProvider]``.


0.30.0 (2017-01-01)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Changed the algorithm that generates unique usernames. Previously, in case the
  provider did not hand over any information to base the username on, the
  username "user" extended with an ever increasing numeric suffix would be
  attempted until a free username was found. In case of a large number of
  existing users, this could result in many queries being executed before a free
  username would be found, potentially resulting in a denial of service. The new
  algorithm uses a random suffix and only one query to determine the final
  username.

- Added a new setting: ``ACCOUNT_PRESERVE_USERNAME_CASING``. This setting
  determines whether the username is stored in lowercase (``False``) or whether
  its casing is to be preserved (``True``). Note that when casing is preserved,
  potentially expensive ``__iexact`` lookups are performed when filter on
  username. For now, the default is set to ``True`` to maintain backwards
  compatibility.

- The OAuth2Adapter class has gained a ``get_callback_url`` method for when
  customizing the callback URL is desired.

- The Battle.net login backend now accepts the ``region`` GET parameter.

- New providers: 500px, Discord.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- In previous versions, the ``DefaultAccountAdapter`` contained a
  ``username_regex`` property and accompanying
  ``error_messages['invalid_username']`` validation error message. These have
  been removed in favor of using the regex validation already defined at the
  user model level. Alternatively, you can use the newly introduced
  ``ACCOUNT_USERNAME_VALIDATORS`` setting.

- The Battle.net backend no longer overrides username regex validation. In
  order to use battletags as usernames, you are expected to override either
  the ``username`` field on your User model, or to pass a custom validator
  which will accept the ``#`` character using the new
  ``ACCOUNT_USERNAME_VALIDATORS`` setting. Such a validator is available in
  ``socialaccount.providers.battlenet.validators.BattletagUsernameValidator``.


0.29.0 (2016-11-21)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Addressed Django 1.10 deprecation warnings.


0.28.0 (2016-10-13)
*******************

Security notice
---------------

- Previous versions contained a vulnerability allowing an attacker to alter the
  provider specific settings for ``SCOPE`` and/or ``AUTH_PARAMS`` (part of the
  larger ``SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS`` setting). The changes would persist across
  subsequent requests for all users, provided these settings were explicitly set
  within your project. These settings translate directly into request
  parameters, giving the attacker undesirable control over the OAuth(2)
  handshake. You are not affected if you did not explicitly configure these
  settings. Thanks to Ryan Kelly for reporting!


Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New providers: Doximity.

- New translations: Korean.


0.27.0 (2016-08-18)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Django 1.10 compatibility.

- The Twitter and GitHub providers now support querying of the email address.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- When ``ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_EMAIL_ENTER_TWICE`` was turned on, the e-mail field key
  changed from ``email`` to ``email1``, which could introduce subtle bugs. This
  has now been changed: there always is an ``email`` field, and optionally an
  ``email2`` field.

- The "You must type the same password each time" form validation error that can
  be triggered during signup is now added to the ``password2`` field instead of
  being added to the non field errors.

- The ``email_confirmation_sent`` signal is now passed ``request``,
  ``confirmation`` and ``signup`` instead of only the ``confirmation``.

- ``ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH`` was already deprecated, but is now completely
  ignored if ``AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`` is not empty.


0.26.1 (2016-07-25)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Locale files wrongly packaged, fixed.

- Fixed bug (``KeyError``) when ``ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_EMAIL_ENTER_TWICE`` was set to
  ``True``.


0.26.0 (2016-07-24)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- New providers: Weixin, Battle.net, Asana, Eve Online, 23andMe, Slack

- Django's password validation mechanism (see ``AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS``) is now
  used to validate passwords.

- By default, email confirmations are no longer stored in the
  database. Instead, the email confirmation mail contains an HMAC
  based key identifying the email address to confirm. The verification
  lookup includes a fallback to the previous strategy so that there is
  no negative impact on pending verification emails.

- A new setting ``ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_EMAIL_ENTER_TWICE`` was added, requiring users to
  input their email address twice. The setting
  ``ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_VERIFICATION`` has been renamed to
  ``ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_ENTER_TWICE``.

- New translations: Latvian, Kyrgyz.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Dropped support for Django 1.6

- In order to accomodate for Django's password validation, the
  ``clean_password`` method of the adapter now takes an (optional)
  ``user`` parameter as its second argument.

- The new HMAC based keys may contain colons. If you have forked
  ``account/urls.py``, be sure to sync the ``account_confirm_email``
  pattern.


0.25.2 (2016-03-13)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Bug fix release (MemcachedKeyCharacterError: "Control characters not allowed")


0.25.1 (2016-03-13)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Bug fix release (AttributeError in password reset view).


0.25.0 (2016-03-12)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Many providers were added: Reddit, Untappd, GitLab, Stripe,
  Pinterest, Shopify, Draugiem, DigitalOcean, Robinhood,
  Bitbucket(OAuth2).

- The account connections view is now AJAX aware.

- You can now customize the template extension that is being used to
  render all HTML templates (``ACCOUNT_TEMPLATE_EXTENSION``)

- In order to be secure by default, users are now blocked from logging
  in after exceeding a maximum number of failed login attempts (see
  ``ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_LIMIT``,
  ``ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_TIMEOUT``). Set
  ``ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_LIMIT`` to ``None`` to disable this
  functionality. Important: while this protects the allauth login view, it
  does not protect Django's admin login from being brute forced.

- New translations: Arabic, Lithuanian


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

None


0.24.1 (2015-11-09)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Non-test code accidentally had test packages as a dependency.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Setting a password after logging in with a social account no longer logs out
  the user by default on Django 1.7+. Setting an initial password and changing
  the password both respect ``settings.ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_ON_PASSWORD_CHANGE``.


0.24.0 (2015-11-08)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Django 1.9b1 compatibility.

- Seppo Erviälä contributed a Finnish translation, thanks!

- Iurii Kriachko contributed a Basecamp provider, thanks!

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Increased ``SocialApp`` key/secret/token sizes to 191, decreased
  ``SocialAccount.uid`` size to 191. The latter was done in order to
  accomodate for MySQL in combination with utf8mb4 and contraints on
  ``uid``. Note that ``uid`` is used to store OpenID URLs, which can
  theoretically be longer than 191 characters, although in practice
  this does not seem to be the case. In case you really need to
  control the ``uid`` length, set ``settings.SOCIALACCOUNT_UID_MAX_LENGTH``
  accordingly. Migrations are in place.


0.23.0 (2015-08-02)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- David Friedman contributed Edmodo support, thanks!

- Added support for ``ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ON_PASSWORD_RESET`` (thanks Julen!)


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

None


0.22.0 (2015-07-23)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Reversal of the email confirmation url can now be overridden in
  the adapter (``get_email_confirmation_url``). Additionally, the
  complete confirmation email handling can be overridden via
  ``send_confirmation_mail``.

- Template context processors are no longer used.

- The Facebook Graph API fields (/me/?fields=...) can now be
  configured using the provider ``FIELDS`` setting.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Dropped support for Python 2.6 and Django <1.6.

- The default Facebook Graph API version is now v2.4.

- Template context processors are no longer used. The context
  processor for ``allauth.account`` was already empty, and the context
  processor for ``allauth.socialaccount`` has been converted into the
  :doc:``{% get_providers %} <templates>`` template tag.


0.21.0 (2015-07-02)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- You can now tweak the authentication params per OAuth provider,
  as you already could for OAuth2. Contributed by Peter Rowlands,
  thanks.

- Nattaphoom Ch. contributed a Thai translation, thanks!

- Guoyu Hao contributed a Baidu provider, thanks!

- Rod Xavier Bondoc contributed support logging out on password
  change (see setting: ``ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_ON_PASSWORD_CHANGE``)


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- In version 0.20.0 an ``account`` migration (``0002_email_max_length``)
  was added to alter the maximum length of the email
  field. Unfortunately, a side effect of this migration was that the
  ``unique=True`` setting slipped through as well. Hardcoding this to
  ``True`` is wrong, as uniqueness actually depends on the
  ``ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_EMAIL`` setting. We cannot create a followup ``0003``
  migration to set things straight, as the ``0002`` migration may fail
  on installations where email addresses are not unique. Therefore, we
  had to resort to changing an existing migration which is normally
  not the right thing to do. In case your installation has
  ``ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_EMAIL`` set to ``True``, you need not take any further
  action. In case it is set to ``False`` and migration ``0002`` already
  ran, please issue a ``--fake`` migration down to ``0001``, followed by a
  re-run of the updated ``0002``.


0.20.0 (2015-05-25)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Patrick Paul contributed a provider for Evernote, thanks!

- Josh Wright contributed a provider for Spotify, thanks!

- Björn Andersson added support for Dropbox OAuth2, thanks!

- guoqiao contributed a provider for Douban, thanks!


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Given that the ``max_length`` for the Django 1.8 ``EmailField`` has been
  bumped to 254, allauth is following up. Migrations (``account``) are
  in place.


0.19.1 (2015-02-05)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Fixed migrations when using South & Django 1.6.


0.19.0 (2015-01-04)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Basil Shubin contributed an Odnoklassniki provider, thanks!

- Facebook: If the JS SDK is not available, for example due to a
  browser plugin like Disconnect.me that blocks it, login falls back
  to the regular non JS handshake.

- ``is_safe_url`` can now be overriden

- Facebook: The Graph API version is now configurable via
  ``SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS``.

- A Firefox Accounts provider was added by Jannis Leidel, thanks!

- Josh Owen contributed Coinbase support, thanks!

- Tomas Babej contributed a Slovak translation, thanks!

- Moved existing migrations into ``south_migrations``

- "zbryikt" contributed a Taiwanese Chinese translation, thanks!

- Added support for custom password rules via ``clean_password``.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- In the upcoming Django 1.8 it is no longer possible to hookup an
  unsaved ``User`` instance to a ``SocialAccount``. Therefore, if you are
  inspecting the ``sociallogin`` object, you should now use
  ``sociallogin.user`` instead of ``sociallogin.account.user``.

- When users logged in while ``User.is_active`` was ``False``, they were
  sent to ``/accounts/inactive/`` in case of a social login, and
  received a form validation error in case of a local login. This
  needless inconsistency has been removed. The validation error no
  longer appears and local logins are also redirected to
  ``/accounts/inactive/``.

- In case you were overriding the ``ResetPasswordForm``: the save method
  now takes ``request`` as its first argument.

- All existing migrations have been moved into ``south_migrations``
  packages, this in order not to conflict with Django's built-in
  support for migrations. South 1.0 automatically picks up this new
  location. Upgrade South if you are still dependent on these
  migrations.


0.18.0 (2014-08-12)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Storing social access tokens is now optional
  (``SOCIALACCOUNT_STORE_TOKENS``).

- ``nimiq`` contributed ORCID support, thanks.

- All forms are now pluggable via a new setting:
  ``(SOCIAL)ACCOUNT_FORMS``.

- James Thompson contributed Windows Live support, thanks!


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- SECURITY: The Persona provider now requires the ``AUDIENCE`` parameter
  to be explicitly configured, as required by the Persona
  specification for security reasons.

- The inline Javascript is removed from the ``fbconnect.html`` template,
  which allows for a more strict ``Content-Security-Policy``. If you
  were using the builtin ``fbconnect.html`` this change should go by
  unnoticed.


0.17.0 (2014-06-16)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- ``sourenaraya`` contributed Mail.Ru support, thanks.

- account: Justin Michalicek contributed support to control
  session life time and age: ``ACCOUNT_SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`` and
  ``ACCOUNT_SESSION_REMEMBER``.

- Serafeim Papastefanos contributed an Ukrainian translation,
  thanks!

- ``kkarwows`` contributed AppConfig support, thanks.

- socialaccount: Added Xing provider.

- socialaccount: Marcin Skarbek contributed Hubic support, thanks!

- Volodymyr Yatsyk contributed an Ukrainian translation, thanks!

- ``joke2k`` contributed an Italian translation, thanks!

- socialaccount: All providers now support the ``VERIFIED_EMAIL``
  property have e-mail addresses forced to be interpreted as
  verified.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

None


0.16.1 (2014-03-12)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Facebook login via Javascript was broken if ``auth_type`` was not
  set to ``reauthenticate``, fixed.
- Support for hooking up a callback when ``FB.init()`` is ready
  (``allauth.facebook.onInit``)

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

None


0.16.0 (2014-03-10)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Nariman Gharib contributed a Persian translation, thanks!

- The custom signup form ``save`` has been deprecated in favour of a
  ``def signup(request, user)`` method.

- Facebook reauthentication now uses an ``auth_nonce``.

- Added a new option ``ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ON_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION``, to
  indicate whether or not e-mail confirmation is to automatically
  log in.

- socialaccount: Added Bitbucket provider.

- Jack Shedd contributed Tumblr support, thanks!

- Romanos Tsouroplis contributed Foursquare support, thanks!

- "excessivedemon" contributed Flickr support, thanks!

- Luis Diego García contributed Amazon and Paypal support, thanks!

- Stuart Ross contributed LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 support, thanks!


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Previously, the ``save(user)`` was called on the custom signup form.
  However, this shadowed the existing ``save`` method in case a model
  form was used. To avoid confusion, the ``save`` method has been
  deprecated in favour of a ``def signup(request, user)`` method.

- The Amazon provider requires more space for ``token_secret``, so the
  maximum length restriction has been dropped. Migrations are in
  place.


0.15.0 (2013-12-01)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- socialaccount: Added ``is_auto_signup_allowed`` to social account
  adapter.

- facebook: Added a new setting: VERIFIED_EMAIL.

- socialaccount: a collision on e-mail address when you sign up
  using a third party social account is now more clearly explained:
  "An account already exists with this e-mail address.  Please sign
  in to that account first, then connect your Google account".

- account: You are now automatically logged in after confirming
  your e-mail address during sign up.

- account: The ``/accounts/login/`` view now supports AJAX requests.

- facebook: The fbconnect.js script is now more pluggable.

- socialaccount: Markus Kaiserswerth contributed a Feedly
  provider, thanks!

- socialaccount: Dropped django-avatar support.

- openid: First, last and full name are now also queried together
  with the e-mail address. Thanks, @andrvb.

- openid: Compatibility fix for Django 1.6 (JSON serializer).

- account: Added support for ``ACCOUNT_CONFIRM_EMAIL_ON_GET``.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Instead of directly rendering and returning a template, logging in
  while the account is inactive or not yet confirmed now redirects to
  two new views: ``/accounts/inactive/`` respectively
  ``/accounts/confirm-email/``.

- The ``account/verification_sent.html`` template no longer receives the
  e-mail address in the context (``email``). Note that a message
  containing that e-mail address is still emitted using the messages
  framework.

- The ``/accounts/confirm_email/key/`` view has been
  renamed to ``/accounts/confirm-email/`` (human friendlier). Redirects
  are in place to handle old still pending confirmations.

- Built-in support for django-avatar has been removed. Offering such
  functionality means making choices which may not be valid for
  everyone. For example, allauth was downloading the image (which can
  take some time, or even block) in the context of the login, whereas
  a better place might be some celery background job. Additionally, in
  case of an error it simply ignored this. How about retries et al?
  Also, do you want to copy the avatar once at sign up, or do you want
  to update on each login? All in all, this functionality goes way
  beyond authentication and should be addressed elsewhere, beyond
  allauth scope. The original code has been preserved here so that you
  can easily reinstate it in your own project:
  https://gist.github.com/pennersr/7571752


0.14.2 (2013-11-16)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Compatibility fix for logging in with Django 1.6.

- Maksim Rukomoynikov contributed a Russian translation, thanks!


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- In case you were using the internal method
  ``generate_unique_username``, note that its signature has changed. It
  now takes a list of candidates to base the username on.


0.14.1 (2013-10-28)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- PyPi did not render the README.rst properly.


Backwards incompatible changes

0.14.0 (2013-10-28)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Stuart Ross contributed AngelList support, thanks!

- LinkedIn: profile fields that are to be fetched are now
  configurable (``PROFILE_FIELDS`` provider-level setting).

- Udi Oron contributed a Hebrew translation, thanks!

- Add setting ``ACCOUNT_DEFAULT_HTTP_PROTOCOL`` (HTTPS support).

- George Whewell contributed Instagram support, thanks!

- Refactored adapter methods relating to creating and populating
  ``User`` instances.

- User creation methods in the ``Default(Social)AccountAdapter`` now
  have access to the ``request``.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- The ``socialaccount/account_inactive.html`` template has been
  moved to ``account/account_inactive.html``.

- The adapter API for creating and populating users has been
  overhauled. As a result, the ``populate_new_user`` adapter methods
  have disappeared. Please refer to the section on "Creating and
  Populating User Instances" for more information.


0.13.0 (2013-08-31)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Koichi Harakawa contributed a Japanese translation, thanks!

- Added ``is_open_for_signup`` to DefaultSocialAccountAdapter.

- Added VK provider support.

- Marcin Spoczynski contributed a Polish translation, thanks!

- All views are now class-based.

- ``django.contrib.messages`` is now optional.

- "jresins" contributed a simplified Chinese, thanks!


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- The password reset from key success response now redirects to a
  "done" view (``/accounts/password/reset/key/done/``). This view has
  its own ``account/password_reset_from_key_done.html`` template. In
  previous versions, the success template was intertwined with the
  ``account/password_reset_from_key.html`` template.


0.12.0 (2013-07-01)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Added support for re-authenticated (forced prompt) by means of a
  new ``action="reauthenticate"`` parameter to the ``{%
  provider_login_url %}``

- Roberto Novaes contributed a Brazilian Portuguese translation,
  thanks!

- Daniel Eriksson contributed a Swedish translation, thanks!

- You can now logout from both allauth and Facebook via a
  Javascript helper: ``window.allauth.facebook.logout()``.

- Connecting a social account is now a flow that needs to be
  explicitly triggered, by means of a ``process="connect"`` parameter
  that can be passed along to the ``{% provider_login_url %}``, or a
  ``process=connect`` GET parameter.

- Tomas Marcik contributed a Czech translation, thanks!


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- The ``{% provider_login_url %}`` tag now takes an optional process
  parameter that indicates how to process the social login. As a
  result, if you include the template
  ``socialaccount/snippets/provider_list.html`` from your own overriden
  ``socialaccount/connections.html`` template, you now need to pass
  along the process parameter as follows:
  ``{% include "socialaccount/snippets/provider_list.html" with process="connect" %}``.

- Instead of inlining the required Facebook SDK Javascript wrapper
  code into the HTML, it now resides into its own .js file (served
  with ``{% static %}``). If you were using the builtin ``fbconnect.html``
  this change should go by unnoticed.


0.11.1 (2013-06-04)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Released (due to issue in disconnecting social accounts).

Backwards incompatible changes

0.11.0 (2013-06-02)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Moved logic whether or not a social account can be disconnected
  to the ``SocialAccountAdapter`` (``validate_disconnect``).

- Added ``social_account_removed`` signal.

- Implemented CSRF protection
  (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-30#section-10.12).

- The ``user_logged_in`` signal now optionally receives a
  ``sociallogin`` parameter, in case of a social login.

- Added ``social_account_added`` (contributed by orblivion, thanks).

- Hatem Nassrat contributed Bitly support, thanks!

- Bojan Mihelac contributed a Croatian translation, thanks!

- Messages (as in ``django.contrib.messages``) are now configurable
  through templates.
- Added support for differentiating e-mail handling (verification,
  required) between local and social accounts:
  ``SOCIALACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED`` and
  ``SOCIALACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION``.

0.10.1 (2013-04-16)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Cleaning of ``username`` can now be overriden via
  ``DefaultAccountAdapter.clean_username``

- Fixed potential error (``assert``) when connecting social
  accounts.

- Added support for custom username handling in case of custom
  user models (``ACCOUNT_USER_MODEL_USERNAME_FIELD``).


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

None


0.10.0 (2013-04-12)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Chris Davis contributed Vimeo support, thanks!

- Added support for overriding the URL to return to after
  connecting a social account
  (``allauth.socialaccount.adapter.DefaultSocialAccountAdapter.get_connect_redirect_url``).

- Python 3 is now supported!

- Dropped dependency on (unmaintained?) oauth2 package, in favor
  of requests-oauthlib.

- account: E-mail confirmation mails generated at signup can now
  be differentiated from regular e-mail confirmation mails by
  placing e.g. a welcome message into the
  ``account/email/email_confirmation_signup*`` templates. Thanks to
  Sam Solomon for the patch.

- account: Moved User instance creation to adapter so that e.g.
  username generation can be influenced. Thanks to John Bazik for
  the patch.

- Robert Balfre contributed Dropbox support, thanks!

- socialaccount: Added support for Weibo.

- account: Added support for sending HTML e-mail. Add
  ``*_message.html`` templates and they will be automatically picked
  up.

- Added support for passing along extra parameters to the OAuth2
  authentication calls, such as ``access_type`` (Google) or
  ``auth_type`` (Facebook).
- Both the login and signup view now immediately redirect to the
  login redirect url in case the user was already authenticated.

- Added support for closing down signups in a pluggable fashion,
  making it easy to hookup your own invitation handling mechanism.

- Added support for passing along extra parameters to the
  ``FB.login`` API call.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Logout no longer happens on GET request. Refer to the ``LogoutView``
  documentation for more background information. Logging out on GET
  can be restored by the setting ``ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_ON_GET``. Furthermore,
  after logging out you are now redirected to
  ``ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`` instead of rendering the
  ``account/logout.html`` template.

- ``LOGIN_REDIRECT_URLNAME`` is now deprecated. Django 1.5 accepts both
  URL names and URLs for ``LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL``, so we do so as well.

- ``DefaultAccountAdapter.stash_email_verified`` is now named
  ``stash_verified_email``.

- Django 1.4.3 is now the minimal requirement.

- Dropped dependency on (unmaintained?) oauth2 package, in favor of
  requests-oauthlib. So you will need to update your (virtual)
  environment accordingly.

- We noticed a very rare bug that affects end users who add Google
  social login to existing accounts. The symptom is you end up with
  users who have multiple primary email addresses which conflicts
  with assumptions made by the code. In addition to fixing the code
  that allowed duplicates to occur, there is a management command
  you can run if you think this effects you (and if it doesn't effect
  you there is no harm in running it anyways if you are unsure):

  - ``python manage.py account_unsetmultipleprimaryemails``

    - Will silently remove primary flags for email addresses that
      aren't the same as ``user.email``.

    - If no primary ``EmailAddress`` is ``user.email`` it will pick one
      at random and print a warning.

- The expiry time, if any, is now stored in a new column
  ``SocialToken.expires_at``. Migrations are in place.

- Furthermore, Facebook started returning longer tokens, so the
  maximum token length was increased. Again, migrations are in place.

- Login and signup views have been turned into class-based views.

- The template variable ``facebook_perms`` is no longer passed to the
  "facebook/fbconnect.html" template. Instead, ``fb_login_options``
  containing all options is passed.


0.9.0 (2013-01-30)
******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- account: ``user_signed_up`` signal now emits an optional
  ``sociallogin`` parameter so that receivers can easily differentiate
  between local and social signups.

- account: Added ``email_removed`` signal.

- socialaccount: Populating of User model fields is now
  centralized in the adapter, splitting up ``name`` into ``first_name``
  and ``last_name`` if these were not individually available.

- Ahmet Emre Aladağ contributed a Turkish translation, thanks!

- socialaccount: Added SocialAccountAdapter hook to allow for
  intervention in social logins.

- google: support for Google's ``verified_email`` flag to determine
  whether or not to send confirmation e-mails.

- Fábio Santos contributed a Portugese translation, thanks!

- socialaccount: Added support for Stack Exchange.

- socialaccount: Added ``get_social_accounts`` template tag.

- account: Default URL to redirect to after login can now be
  overriden via the adapter, both for login and e-mail confirmation
  redirects.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- ``requests`` is now a dependency (dropped ``httplib2``).

- Added a new column ``SocialApp.client_id``. The value of ``key`` needs
  to be moved to the new ``client_id`` column. The ``key`` column is
  required for Stack Exchange. Migrations are in place to handle all
  of this automatically.


0.8.3 (2012-12-06)
******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Markus Thielen contributed a German translation, thanks!

- The ``site`` foreign key from ``SocialApp`` to ``Site`` has been replaced
  by a ``ManyToManyField``. Many apps can be used across multiple domains
  (Facebook cannot).

- account: Added adapter class for increased pluggability. Added
  hook for 3rd party invitation system to by pass e-mail
  verification (``stash_email_verified``). Moved sending of mail to
  adapter.

- account: Added option to completely disable e-mail verification
  during signup.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- The ``ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`` setting is no longer a boolean
  based setting. Use a string value of "none", "optional" or
  "mandatory" instead.

- The template "account/password_reset_key_message.txt" has been moved
  to "account/email/password_reset_key_message.txt". The subject of
  the message has been moved into a template
  ("account/email/password_reset_key_subject.txt").

- The ``site`` foreign key from ``SocialApp`` to ``Site`` has been replaced
  by a ``ManyToManyField``. Many apps can be used across multiple
  domains (Facebook cannot).


0.8.2 (2012-10-10)
******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Twitter: Login was broken due to change at in URLs at Twitter,
  fixed.

- LinkedIn: Added support for passing along the OAuth scope.

- account: Improved e-mail confirmation error handling, no more
  confusing 404s.

- account: Aldiantoro Nugroho contributed support for a new
  setting: ACCOUNT_USERNAME_MIN_LENGTH

- socialaccount: Added preliminary support for Mozilla Persona.

- account: Sam Solomon added various signals for email and
  password related changes.

- account: Usernames may now contain @, +, . and - characters.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Dropped support for ``CONTACT_EMAIL`` from the ``account`` template
  context processor. It was never documented and only used in the
  templates as an example -- there is no need to pollute the ``allauth``
  settings with that. If your templates rely on it then you will have
  to put it in a context processor yourself.


0.8.1 (2012-09-03)
******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Python 2.6.2 compatibility issue, fixed.

- The example project was unintentionally packaged, fixed.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

None


0.8.0 (2012-09-01)
******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- account: Dropped dependency on the emailconfirmation app,
  integrating its functionality into the account app. This change is
  of major impact, please refer to the documentation on how to
  upgrade.

- account: Documented ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED. This is actually
  not a new setting, but it somehow got overlooked in the
  documentation.

- account/socialaccount: Dropped the _tags postfix from the
  template tag libraries. Simply use {% load account %} and {% load
  socialaccount %}.

- Added signup and social login signals.

- SoundCloud: Rabi Alam contributed a SoundCloud provider, thanks!

- account: Sam Solomon cleaned up the e-mail management view:
  added proper redirect after POSTs, prevent deletion of primary
  e-mail. Thanks.

- account: When signing up, instead of generating a completely
  random username a more sensible username is automatically derived
  from first/last name or e-mail.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- ``allauth`` now depends on Django 1.4 or higher.

- Major impact: dropped dependency on the ``emailconfirmation`` app, as
  this project is clearly left unmaintained. Important tickets such
  as https://github.com/pinax/django-email-confirmation/pull/5 are not
  being addressed. All models and related functionality have been
  directly integrated into the ``allauth.account`` app. When upgrading
  take care of the following:

  - The ``emailconfirmation`` setting ``EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_DAYS`` has been
    replaced by ``ACCOUNT_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_EXPIRE_DAYS``.

  - Instead of directly confirming the e-mail address upon the GET
    request the confirmation is now processed as part of an explicit
    POST. Therefore, a new template ``account/email_confirm.html`` must
    be setup.

  - Existing ``emailconfirmation`` data should be migrated to the new
    tables. For this purpose a special management command is
    available: ``python manage.py
    account_emailconfirmationmigration``. This command does not drop
    the old ``emailconfirmation`` tables -- you will have to do this
    manually yourself. Why not use South? EmailAddress uniqueness
    depends on the configuration (``ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_EMAIL``), South does
    not handle settings dependent database models.

- ``{% load account_tags %}`` is deprecated, simply use: ``{% load account %}``

- ``{% load socialaccount_tags %}`` is deprecated, simply use:
  ``{% load socialaccount %}``


0.7.0 (2012-07-18)
******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Facebook: Facundo Gaich contributed support for dynamically
  deriving the Facebook locale from the Django locale, thanks!.

- OAuth: All OAuth/OAuth2 tokens are now consistently stored
  across the board. Cleaned up OAuth flow removing superfluous
  redirect.

- Facebook: Dropped Facebook SDK dependency.

- socialaccount: DRY focused refactoring of social login.

- socialaccount: Added support for Google OAuth2 and Facebook
  OAuth2. Fixed GitHub.

- account: Added verified_email_required decorator.

- socialaccount: When signing up, user.first/last_name where
  always taken from the provider signup data, even when a custom
  signup form was in place that offered user inputs for editting
  these fields. Fixed.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

None


0.6.0 (2012-06-20)
******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- account: Added ACCOUNT_USER_DISPLAY to render a user name
  without making assumptions on how the user is represented.

- allauth, socialaccount: Removed the last remaining bits of
  hardcodedness with respect to the enabled social authentication
  providers.

- account: Added ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD setting, supporting
  login by username, e-mail or both.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- The ``ACCOUNT_EMAIL_AUTHENTICATION`` setting has been dropped in favor
  of ``ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD``.

- The login form field is now always named ``login``. This used to by
  either ``username`` or ``email``, depending on the authentication
  method. If needed, update your templates accordingly.

- The ``allauth`` template tags (containing template tags for
  OpenID, Twitter and Facebook) have been removed. Use the
  ``socialaccount`` template tags instead (specifically: ``{% provider_login_url
  ... %}``).

- The ``allauth.context_processors.allauth`` context processor has been
  removed, in favor of
  ``allauth.socialaccount.context_processors.socialaccount``. In doing
  so, all hardcodedness with respect to providers (e.g
  ``allauth.facebook_enabled``) has been removed.


0.5.0 (2012-06-08)
******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- account: Added setting ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH for
  specifying the minimum password length.

- socialaccount: Added generic OAuth2 support. Added GitHub
  support as proof of concept.

- socialaccount: More refactoring: generic provider & OAuth
  consumer approach. Added LinkedIn support to test this approach.

- socialaccount: Introduced generic models for storing social
  apps, accounts and tokens in a central and consistent manner,
  making way for adding support for more account providers. Note:
  there is more refactoring to be done -- this first step only
  focuses on the database models.

- account: E-mail confirmation mails are now automatically resent
  whenever a user attempts to login with an unverified e-mail
  address (if ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=True).


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Upgrade your ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``: Replace ``allauth.<provider>``
  (where provider is one of ``twitter``, ``facebook`` or ``openid``) with
  ``allauth.socialaccount.providers.<provider>``

- All provider related models (``FacebookAccount``, ``FacebookApp``,
  ``TwitterAccount``, ``TwitterApp``, ``OpenIDAccount``) have been unified
  into generic ``SocialApp`` and ``SocialAccount`` models. South migrations
  are in place to move the data over to the new models, after which
  the original tables are dropped. Therefore, be sure to run migrate
  using South.


0.4.0 (2012-03-25)
******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- account: The render_value parameter of all PasswordInput fields
  used can now be configured via a setting.

- account: Added support for prefixing the subject of sent emails.

- account: Added support for a plugging in a custom signup form
  used for additional questions to ask during signup.

- account: ``is_active`` is no longer used to keep users with an
  unverified e-mail address from loging in.

- Dropping uniform dependency. Moved uniform templates into
  example project.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

None


0.3.0 (2012-01-19)
******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- The e-mail authentication backend now attempts to use the
  'username' parameter as an e-mail address. This is needed to
  properly integrate with other apps invoking authenticate.

- SmileyChris contributed support for automatically generating a
  user name at signup when ``ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED`` is set to
  False.

- Vuong Nguyen contributed support for (optionally) asking for the
  password just once during signup
  (``ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_VERIFICATION``).

- The Twitter oauth sequence now respects the "oauth_callback"
  parameter instead of defaulting to the callback URL
  configured at Twitter.

- Pass along ``?next=`` parameter between login and signup views.

- Added Dutch translation.

- Added template tags for pointing to social login URLs. These
  tags automatically pass along any ``?next=``
  parameter. Additionally, added an overall allauth_tags that
  gracefully degrades when e.g. allauth.facebook is not installed.

- Pass along next URL, if any, at ``/accounts/social/signup/``.

- Duplicate email address handling could throw a
  MultipleObjectsReturned exception, fixed.

- Removed separate social account login view, in favour of having
  a single unified login view including both forms of login.

- Added support for passing along a next URL parameter to
  Facebook, OpenID logins.

- Added support for django-avatar, copying the Twitter profile
  image locally on signup.

- ``allauth/account/forms.py`` (``BaseSignupForm.clean_email``): With
  ``ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED=False``, empty email addresses were
  considered duplicates. Fixed.

- The existing migrations for allauth.openid were not compatible
  with MySQL due to the use of an URLField with max_length above
  255. The issue has now been addressed but unfortunately at the
  cost of the existing migrations for this app. Existing
  installations will have to be dealt with manually (altering the
  "identity" column of OpenIDAccount, deleting ghost migrations).
