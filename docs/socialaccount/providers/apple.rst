Note: Sign In With Apple uses a slight variation of OAuth2, which uses a POST
instead of a GET. Unlike a GET with SameSite=Lax, the session cookie will not
get sent along with a POST. If you encounter 'PermissionDenied' errors during
Apple log in, check that you don't have any 3rd party middleweare that is
generating a new session on this cross-origin POST, as this will prevent the
login process from being able to access the original session after the POST
completes.
