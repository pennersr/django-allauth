Configuration
=============

Available settings:

ACCOUNT_ADAPTER (="allauth.account.adapter.DefaultAccountAdapter")
  Specifies the adapter class to use, allowing you to alter certain
  default behaviour.

ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD (="username" | "email" | "username_email")
  Specifies the login method to use -- whether the user logs in by
  entering their username, e-mail address, or either one of both.
  Setting this to "email" requires ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED=True

ACCOUNT_CONFIRM_EMAIL_ON_GET (=False)
  Determines whether or not an e-mail address is automatically confirmed
  by a mere GET request.

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_ANONYMOUS_REDIRECT_URL (=settings.LOGIN_URL)
  The URL to redirect to after a successful e-mail confirmation, in case no
  user is logged in.

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_AUTHENTICATED_REDIRECT_URL (=None)
  The URL to redirect to after a successful e-mail confirmation, in
  case of an authenticated user. Set to `None` to use
  `settings.LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`.

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_EXPIRE_DAYS (=3)
  Determines the expiration date of email confirmation mails (# of days).

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED (=False)
  The user is required to hand over an e-mail address when signing up.

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION (="optional")
  Determines the e-mail verification method during signup -- choose
  one of `"mandatory"`, `"optional"`, or `"none"`. When set to
  "mandatory" the user is blocked from logging in until the email
  address is verified. Choose "optional" or "none" to allow logins
  with an unverified e-mail address. In case of "optional", the e-mail
  verification mail is still sent, whereas in case of "none" no e-mail
  verification mails are sent.

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX (="[Site] ")
  Subject-line prefix to use for email messages sent. By default, the
  name of the current `Site` (`django.contrib.sites`) is used.

ACCOUNT_DEFAULT_HTTP_PROTOCOL = (="http")
  The default protocol used for when generating URLs, e.g. for the
  password forgotten procedure. Note that this is a default only --
  see the section on HTTPS for more information.

ACCOUNT_FORMS (={})
  Used to override forms, for example:
  `{'login': 'myapp.forms.LoginForm'}`

ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_ON_GET (=False)
  Determines whether or not the user is automatically logged out by a
  mere GET request. See documentation for the `LogoutView` for
  details.

ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_ON_PASSWORD_CHANGE (=False)
  Determines whether or not the user is automatically logged out after
  changing the password. See documentation for `Django's session invalidation on password change <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/auth/default/#session-invalidation-on-password-change>`_. (Django 1.7+)

ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL (="/")
  The URL (or URL name) to return to after the user logs out. This is
  the counterpart to Django's `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`.

ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FORM_CLASS (=None)
  A string pointing to a custom form class
  (e.g. 'myapp.forms.SignupForm') that is used during signup to ask
  the user for additional input (e.g. newsletter signup, birth
  date). This class should implement a `def signup(self, request, user)`
  method, where user represents the newly signed up user.

ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_VERIFICATION (=True)
  When signing up, let the user type in their password twice to avoid typo's.

ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_EMAIL (=True)
  Enforce uniqueness of e-mail addresses.

ACCOUNT_USER_MODEL_USERNAME_FIELD (="username")
  The name of the field containing the `username`, if any. See custom
  user models.

ACCOUNT_USER_MODEL_EMAIL_FIELD (="email")
  The name of the field containing the `email`, if any. See custom
  user models.

ACCOUNT_USER_DISPLAY (=a callable returning `user.username`)
  A callable (or string of the form `'some.module.callable_name'`)
  that takes a user as its only argument and returns the display name
  of the user. The default implementation returns `user.username`.

ACCOUNT_USERNAME_MIN_LENGTH (=1)
  An integer specifying the minimum allowed length of a username.

ACCOUNT_USERNAME_BLACKLIST (=[])
  A list of usernames that can't be used by user.

ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED (=True)
  The user is required to enter a username when signing up. Note that
  the user will be asked to do so even if
  `ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD` is set to `email`. Set to `False`
  when you do not wish to prompt the user to enter a username.

ACCOUNT_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PROXY (="")
  Redirect the login callback to this remote server or endpoint, instead of the
  default endpoint on the local server. The remote server could be any server.
  However, it is suggested that the remote server be an instance of the local
  server, at a dedicated URL. By enabling
  ACCOUNT_LOGIN_PROXY_REDIRECT_WHITELIST on the remote server, it will function
  as a reverse proxy. It will forward the callback request to the local server.

  This is useful for working around an OAuth2 redirect_uri whitelist.

  Specifically, this is useful for authenticating arbitrarily-named and
  short-lived feature deploys on Google's OAuth2 endpoint. Rather than
  adding each name to the redirect_uri whitelist, one can permanently
  redirect to the LOGIN_CALLBACK_PROXY instead, which forwards the OAuth2 code
  to the feature-deploy.

ACCOUNT_LOGIN_PROXY_REDIRECT_WHITELIST (="")
  List of remote servers to which this server may forward OAuth2 token proxy
  redirects (see above).

ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_INPUT_RENDER_VALUE (=False)
  `render_value` parameter as passed to `PasswordInput` fields.

ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH (=6)
  An integer specifying the minimum password length.

ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ON_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION (=True)
  The default behaviour is to automatically log users in once they confirm
  their email address. Note however that this only works when confirming
  the email address **immediately after signing up**, assuming users
  didn't close their browser or used some sort of private browsing mode.

  By changing this setting to `False` they will not be logged in, but
  redirected to the `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_ANONYMOUS_REDIRECT_URL`

ACCOUNT_SESSION_REMEMBER (=None)
  Controls the life time of the session. Set to `None` to ask the user
  ("Remember me?"), `False` to not remember, and `True` to always
  remember.

ACCOUNT_SESSION_COOKIE_AGE (=1814400)
  How long before the session cookie expires in seconds.  Defaults to 1814400 seconds,
  or 3 weeks.

SOCIALACCOUNT_ADAPTER (="allauth.socialaccount.adapter.DefaultSocialAccountAdapter")
  Specifies the adapter class to use, allowing you to alter certain
  default behaviour.

SOCIALACCOUNT_QUERY_EMAIL (=ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED)
  Request e-mail address from 3rd party account provider? E.g. using
  OpenID AX, or the Facebook "email" permission.

SOCIALACCOUNT_AUTO_SIGNUP (=True)
  Attempt to bypass the signup form by using fields (e.g. username,
  email) retrieved from the social account provider. If a conflict
  arises due to a duplicate e-mail address the signup form will still
  kick in.

SOCIALACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED (=ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED)
  The user is required to hand over an e-mail address when signing up
  using a social account.

SOCIALACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION (=ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION)
  As `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`, but for social accounts.

SOCIALACCOUNT_FORMS (={})
  Used to override forms, for example:
  `{'signup': 'myapp.forms.SignupForm'}`

SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS (= dict)
  Dictionary containing provider specific settings.

SOCIALACCOUNT_STORE_TOKENS (=True)
  Indicates whether or not the access tokens are stored in the database.
