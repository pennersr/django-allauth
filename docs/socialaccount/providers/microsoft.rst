Microsoft Graph
-----------------

Microsoft Graph API is the gateway to connect to mail, calendar, contacts,
documents, directory, devices and more.

Apps can be registered (for consumer key and secret) here
    https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade

By default, ``common`` (``organizations`` and ``consumers``) tenancy is configured
for the login. To restrict it, change the ``tenant`` setting as shown below.

.. code-block:: python

  SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {
      "microsoft": {
          "APPS": [
              {
                  "client_id": "<insert-id>",
                  "secret": "<insert-secret>",
                  "settings": {
                      "tenant": "organizations",
                  }
              }
          ]
      }
  }

.. note:: When you have configured your application to use single tenant authentication make sure to use the fragment above to set the ``"tenant"`` value to ``"organizations"`` in order to prevent the following error:

   .. error:: AADSTS50194: Application 'application id' (application name) is not configured as a multi-tenant application. Usage of the /common endpoint is not supported for such applications created after '10/15/2018'. Use a tenant-specific endpoint or configure the application to be multi-tenant.
