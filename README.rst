==========================
Welcome to django-allauth!
==========================

Integrated set of Django applications addressing authentication,
registration, account management as well as 3rd party (social) account
authentication.

Rationale
=========

Why?
----

Most existing Django apps that address the problem of social
authentication focus on just that. You typically need to integrate
another app in order to support authentication via a local
account. 

This approach separates the world of local and social
authentication. However, there are common scenarios to be dealt with
in boh worlds. For example, an e-mail address passed along by an
OpenID provider is not guaranteed to be verified. So, before hooking
an OpenID account up to a local account the e-mail address must be
verified. So, e-mail verification needs to be present in both worlds.

Integrating both worlds is quite a tedious process. It is definately
not a matter of simply adding one social authentication app, and one
local account registration app to your `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

This is the reason this project got started -- to offer a fully
integrated authentication app that allows for both local and social
authentication, with flows that just work.


Why Not?
--------

From the start the focus has been to deliver an integrated experience
and flows that just work, and to a lesser extent a completely
pluggable social authentication framework.

Earlier versions of the project suffered from this, e.g. each provider
had its own implementation with its own social account model
definition. 

Work is well underway to rectify this situation. These days, social
account models have been unified, and adding support for additional
OAuth/OAuth2 providers is child's play.

Ofcourse, there is always more that can be done. Do know that the
biggest hurdles to overcome the initial shortcomings have been
taken...

Overview
========

Supported Flows
---------------

- Signup of a both local and social accounts

- Connecting more than one social account to a local account

- Disconnecting a social account -- requires setting a password if
  only the local account remains

- Optional instant-signup for social accounts -- no questions asked

- E-mail address management (multiple e-mail addresses, setting a primary)

- Password forgotten flow

- E-mail address verification flow

Supported Providers
-------------------

- Facebook

- Github

- LinkedIn

- OpenId

- Twitter

Note: OAuth/OAuth2 support is built using a common code base, making it easy to add support for additional OAuth/OAuth2 providers. More will follow soon...

 
Features
--------

- Supports multiple authentication schemes (e.g. login by user name,
  or by e-mail), as well as multiple strategies for account
  verification (ranging from none to e-mail verification).

- Facebook access token is stored so that you can publish wall updates
  etc.

Architecture & Design
---------------------

- Pluggable signup form for asking additional questions during signup.

- Support for connecting multiple social accounts to a Django user account.

- The required consumer keys and secrets for interacting with
  Facebook, Twitter and the likes are to be configured in the database
  via the Django admin using the SocialApp model.

- Consumer keys, tokens make use of the Django sites framework. This
  is especially helpful for larger multi-domain projects, but also
  allows for for easy switching between a development (localhost) and
  production setup without messing with your settings and database.


Installation
============

- "pip install django-allauth" is NOT supported. Do NOT install it using pip. Pip will get you the old version.
- Makse sure all the modules mentioned in "requirements.txt" are already installed.
- Download the repository from Github, and extract the "allauth" folder.
- Place the "allauth" folder in your "site-packages"
- Make sure there is a "base.html" in your templates folder, with a block called "content"
- If you are using South, make sure you create initial migrations for ALL the apps. e.g. "manage.py schemamigration allauth.socialaccount.providers.twitter"
- After you have installed the apps (settings.py + urls.py + datamigration), login to your admin panel and add the details for twitter and facebook (if they are enabled)


Django
------

settings.py::

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        ...
        "django.core.context_processors.request",
        "allauth.context_processors.allauth",
        "allauth.account.context_processors.account"
    )

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ( ...
        "allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend", )

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'emailconfirmation',

        'allauth',
        'allauth.account',
        'allauth.socialaccount',
        'allauth.socialaccount.providers.twitter',
        'allauth.socialaccount.providers.linkedin',
        'allauth.socialaccount.providers.openid',
        'allauth.socialaccount.providers.facebook',
        'allauth.socialaccount.providers.github',

urls.py::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        (r'^accounts/', include('allauth.urls')))


Configuration
-------------

Available settings:

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED (=False)
  The user is required to hand over an e-mail address when signing up.

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION (=False)
  After signing up, keep the user account inactive until the e-mail
  address is verified.

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_AUTHENTICATION (=False)
  Login by e-mail address, not username.

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX (="[Site] ")
  Subject-line prefix to use for email messages sent. By default, the
  name of the current `Site` (`django.contrib.sites`) is used.

ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FORM_CLASS (=None)
  A string pointing to a custom form class
  (e.g. 'myapp.forms.SignupForm') that is used during signup to ask
  the user for additional input (e.g. newsletter signup, birth
  date). This class should implement a 'save' method, accepting the
  newly signed up user as its only parameter.

ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_VERIFICATION (=True)
  When signing up, let the user type in his password twice to avoid typ-o's.

ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_EMAIL (=True)
  Enforce uniqueness of e-mail addresses.

ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED (=True)
  If false, generates a random username rather than prompting for one
  at signup.

ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_INPUT_RENDER_VALUE (=False)
  `render_value` parameter as passed to `PasswordInput` fields.

ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH (=6)
  An integer specifying the minimum password length.

SOCIALACCOUNT_QUERY_EMAIL (=ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED)
  Request e-mail address from 3rd party account provider? E.g. using
  OpenID AX, or the Facebook "email" permission.

SOCIALACCOUNT_AUTO_SIGNUP (=True) 
  Attempt to bypass the signup form by using fields (e.g. username,
  email) retrieved from the social account provider. If a conflict
  arises due to a duplicate e-mail address the signup form will still
  kick in.

SOCIALACCOUNT_AVATAR_SUPPORT (= 'avatar' in settings.INSTALLED_APPS)
  Enable support for django-avatar. When enabled, the profile image of
  the user is copied locally into django-avatar at signup.

EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_DAYS (=# of days, no default)
  Determines the expiration date of email confirmation mails sent by
  django-email-confirmation.
