    description: |
      The API used for manipulating the email addresses attached to a given
      account. This is intentionally modeled as one endpoint, representing the
      collection of all the email addresses. Note that manipulating one email
      address may affect another.  For example, marking one email address as
      primary implies the previous primary email address is changed as
      well. Also, if django-allauth is configured with `ACCOUNT_CHANGE_EMAIL =
      True`, verifying the email address the user is changing to will cause the
      previous email addres to be removed.

        There are many configuration options that alter the functionality
        and behavior of django-allauth, some of which can also impact the
        frontend. Therefore, relevant configuration options are exposed via
        this endpoint. The data returned is not user/authentication
        dependent. Hence, it suffices to only fetch this data once at boot
        time of your application.

      description: |
        Complete the email verification process. Depending on the configuration,
        email addresses are either verified by opening a link that is sent to
        their email address, or, by inputting a code that is sent. On the API,
        both cases are handled identically. Meaning, the required key is either
        the one from the link, or, the code itself.

        Note that a status code of 401 does not imply failure. It indicates that
        the email verification was successful, yet, the user is still not signed
        in. For example, in case `ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ON_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION` is set to
        `False`, a 401 is returned when verifying as part of login/signup.

        In order to safeguard the account, some actions require the user to be
        recently authenticated.  If you try to perform such an action without
        having been recently authenticated, a `401` status is returned, listing
        flows that can be performed to reauthenticate. One such flow is the flow
        with ID `reauthenticate`, which allows for the user to input the
        password. This is the endpoint related towards that flow.

        Initiates the password reset procedure. Depending on whether or not
        `ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_RESET_BY_CODE_ENABLED` is `True`, the procedure is
        either stateless or stateful.

        In case codes are used, it is stateful, and a new
        `password_reset_by_code` flow is started. In this case, on a successful
        password reset request, you will receive a 401 indicating the pending
        status of this flow.

        In case password reset is configured to use (stateless) links, you will
        receive a 200 on a successful password reset request.

        Authenticates with a third-party provider using provider tokens received
        by other means. For example, in case of a mobile app, the authentication
        flow runs completely on the device itself, without any interaction with
        the API. Then, when the (device) authentication completes and the mobile
        app receives an access and/or ID token, it can hand over these tokens
        via this endpoint to authenticate on the server.

      summary: Change password
      description: |
        In order to change the password of an account, the current and new
        password must be provider.  However, accounts that were created by
        signing up using a third-party provider do not have a password set. In
        that case, the current password is not required.

          description: |
            The URL to return to after the redirect flow is complete.

            Note that this is not to be mistaken with the callback URL that you
            configure over at the OAuth provider during the OAuth app/client
            setup. The flow is as follows:

              1. Your frontend redirects to the headless provider redirect
                 endpoint in a synchronous (non-XHR) manner, informing allauth
                 (by means of `callback_url`) where to redirect to after the
                 provider handshake is completed.

              2. Headless will redirect to the (OAuth) identity provider to
                 initiate the handshake, passing along a different callback URL
                 to the provider: one that points to an allauth backend URL.
                 This is the URL that you need to have setup at your OAuth
                 app/client configuration. Note that this must be a backend URL
                 as providers can use POST requests to perform their callbacks,
                 which is something a frontend would not be able to handle.

              3. After the authorization at the provider is completed, the
                 provider redirects to the *backend* allauth callback URL, which
                 will then redirect back to the *frontend* callback URL.

              4. Your frontend is now expected to fetch the current session to
                 determine what the next course of action is. The user could be
                 authenticated at this point, or another flow is pending
                 (e.g. email verification, or, provider signup). In case of
                 errors a `?error=` is passed to the frontend callback URL.
