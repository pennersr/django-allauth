2012-06-03  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	apps, accounts and tokens in a central and consistent manner,
	making way for adding support for more account providers. Note:

2012-03-29  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* account: E-mail confirmation mails are now automatically resent

2012-01-06  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* The e-mail authentication backend now attempts to use the

	user name at signup when ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED is set to

	* Added Dutch translation.

2011-04-12  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	gracefully degrades when e.g. allauth.facebook is not installed.

2011-04-11  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* Pass along next URL, if any, at /accounts/social/signup/.

	MultipleObjectsReturned exception, fixed.

	ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED=False, empty email addresses were
	considered duplicates. Fixed.

2010-11-12  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* The existing migrations for allauth.openid were not compatible
	with MySQL due to the use of an URLField with max_length above
	255. The issue has now been addressed but unfortunately at the
	cost of the existing migrations for this app. Existing
	installations will have to be dealt with manually (altering the
	"identity" column of OpenIDAccount, deleting ghost migrations).
