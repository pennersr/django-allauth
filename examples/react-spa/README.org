* React Single-Page Application

This is a proof of concept, demonstrating a React frontend interacting with a
vanilla django-allauth as the backend.

** Status

Note that this is an incomplete work in progress. Its goal is to research what
approach to take to reach a solution where the complete allauth functionality is
accessible in a SPA based architecture.

** Running

First, start by running the containers:

#+begin_src bash
  docker-compose up
#+end_src

Then, visit the app over at http://localhost:10000.
