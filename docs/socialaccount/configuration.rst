Configuration
=============

Available settings:

``SOCIALACCOUNT_ADAPTER`` (default: ``"allauth.socialaccount.adapter.DefaultSocialAccountAdapter"``)
  Specifies the adapter class to use, allowing you to alter certain
  default behaviour.

``SOCIALACCOUNT_AUTO_SIGNUP`` (default: ``True``)
  Attempt to bypass the signup form by using fields (e.g. username,
  email) retrieved from the social account provider. If a conflict
  arises due to a duplicate email address the signup form will still
  kick in.

``SOCIALACCOUNT_EMAIL_AUTHENTICATION`` (default: ``False``)
  Consider a scenario where a social login occurs, and the social account comes
  with a verified email address (verified by the account provider), but that
  email address is already taken by a local user account. Additionally, assume
  that the local user account does not have any social account connected. Now,
  if the provider can be fully trusted, you can argue that we should treat this
  scenario as a login to the existing local user account even if the local
  account does not already have the social account connected, because --
  according to the provider -- the user logging in has ownership of the email
  address.  This is how this scenario is handled when
  ``SOCIALACCOUNT_EMAIL_AUTHENTICATION`` is set to ``True``. As this implies
  that an untrustworthy provider can login to any local account by fabricating
  social account data, this setting defaults to ``False``. Only set it to
  ``True`` if you are using providers that can be fully trusted. Instead of
  turning this on globally, you can also turn it on selectively per provider,
  for example::

      SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {
        'google': {
            'EMAIL_AUTHENTICATION': True
        }
      }

``SOCIALACCOUNT_EMAIL_AUTHENTICATION_AUTO_CONNECT`` (default: ``False``)
  In case email authentication is applied, this setting controls whether or not
  the social account is automatically connected to the local account. In case of
  ``False`` the local account remains unchanged during the login. In case of
  ``True``, the social account for which the email matched, is automatically
  added to the list of social accounts connected to the local account. As a
  result, even if the user were to change the email address afterwards, social
  login would still be possible when using ``True``, but not in case of
  ``False``.

``SOCIALACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`` (default: ``ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION``)
  As ``ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION``, but for social accounts.

``SOCIALACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED`` (default: ``ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED``)
  The user is required to hand over an email address when signing up
  using a social account.

``SOCIALACCOUNT_FORMS``
  Used to override forms. Defaults to::

    SOCIALACCOUNT_FORMS = {
        'disconnect': 'allauth.socialaccount.forms.DisconnectForm',
        'signup': 'allauth.socialaccount.forms.SignupForm',
    }

``SOCIALACCOUNT_LOGIN_ON_GET`` (default: ``False``)
  Controls whether or not the endpoints for initiating a social login (for
  example, "/accounts/google/login/") require a POST request to initiate the
  handshake. For security considerations, it is strongly recommended to
  require POST requests.

``SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS`` (default: ``{}``)
  Dictionary containing `provider specific settings <provider_configuration.html>`__.

``SOCIALACCOUNT_QUERY_EMAIL`` (default: ``ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED``)
  Request email address from 3rd party account provider? E.g. using
  OpenID AX, or the Facebook "email" permission.

``SOCIALACCOUNT_SOCIALACCOUNT_STR`` (default: ``str`` of user object)
  Used to override the str value for the SocialAccount model.

  Must be a function accepting a single parameter for the socialaccount object.

``SOCIALACCOUNT_STORE_TOKENS`` (default: ``False``)
  Indicates whether or not the access tokens are stored in the database.
