First apply and be accepted into the Garmin Connect API program.

This provider only provides userId in the response. You won't find any other information like name or avatar.

You'll first obtain a development key, which has access to all prod data, but is rate limited.
You'll have to get approval from Garmin to get a production key after testing.
