0.18.0 (2014-08-12)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

  (``SOCIALACCOUNT_STORE_TOKENS``).

- ``nimiq`` contributed ORCID support, thanks.

- All forms are now pluggable via a new setting:
  ``(SOCIAL)ACCOUNT_FORMS``.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- SECURITY: The Persona provider now requires the ``AUDIENCE`` parameter
  to be explicitly configured, as required by the Persona
  specification for security reasons.

- The inline Javascript is removed from the ``fbconnect.html`` template,
  which allows for a more strict ``Content-Security-Policy``. If you
  were using the builtin ``fbconnect.html`` this change should go by
  unnoticed.

0.16.0 (2014-03-10)
*******************

Note worthy changes
-------------------

- Nariman Gharib contributed a Persian translation, thanks!

- The custom signup form ``save`` has been deprecated in favour of a
  ``def signup(request, user)`` method.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Previously, the ``save(user)`` was called on the custom signup form.
  However, this shadowed the existing ``save`` method in case a model
  form was used. To avoid confusion, the ``save`` method has been
  deprecated in favour of a ``def signup(request, user)`` method.

- The Amazon provider requires more space for ``token_secret``, so the
  maximum length restriction has been dropped. Migrations are in
  place.
